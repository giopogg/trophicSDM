## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. After the manual check by the CRAN's team, I:

* Added a reference in the DESCRIPTION according to the suggested syntax.
* Added the field \value to the Rd files when it was missing
* Wrote TRUE and FALSE instead of T and F
* Set the print call in trophicSDM.R within if (verbose) as suggested
* Reset to user's par() after changing it
* Ensured that I do not use more than two cores in examples, vignettes, etc.
* Precompiled vignette to reduce check time
* Replaced \dontrun with \donttest in documentation
* Remove "this package" and fixed a typo in package description

* This is a new release.
* Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Poggiato (4:558)
  Thuiller (4:594)
  Trophic (4:101)
  oletti (4:574)
  trophic (4:31, 4:158, 4:364)
  
  However, the word 'Trophic' (i.e., relating to feeding and nutrition) is not misspelled and is a common word in ecology.  Poggiato, Thuiller and Andr√©oletti are the names of the authors of the methodological paper describing the method implemented in the package.
